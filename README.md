# GuessAWordGame

# Project Overview
This project is a Java-based word guessing game designed to strengthen core programming fundamentals, including object-oriented design, control flow, and user interaction. The game allows users to guess letters to uncover a hidden word, applying logic to track correct and incorrect guesses.

This repository represents my ongoing development journey. I will continue refining, optimizing, and improving this project as I grow in my software engineering skills.

# Technologies Used

Java

IntelliJ IDEA

JUnit (for testing, if applicable)

# Learning Objectives

Through this project, I practiced:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Conditional logic and loops

String and Array manipulation

Input validation

Debugging using IDE tools

Writing cleaner and more maintainable code

# Ongoing Improvements

This is an evolving project. Future updates may include:

Code refactoring for better structure

Improved user interface

Additional features (difficulty modes, scoring system, etc.)

Expanded unit testing coverage

Enhanced exception handling

# Why This Project Matters

This game reflects my transition from basic programming exercises to structured software development practices. It demonstrates how I approach problem-solving, debugging, and iterative improvement.

As I continue advancing in data structures, algorithms, and software engineering principles, this repository will serve as a record of my growth.
